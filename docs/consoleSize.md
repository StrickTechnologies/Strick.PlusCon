## Console Size
The `ConsoleSize` class provides a quick and easy method 
for saving/setting/resetting the size of console window 
and the buffer.

The default (parameterless) constructor will save the size 
of the console window and buffer. You can then resize the 
console window, and later use the `SetConsoleSize` method 
to restore the console window and buffer back to their 
original sizes.
